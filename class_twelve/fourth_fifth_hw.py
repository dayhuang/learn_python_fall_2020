    Read a file called gifts.in
    First five lines, each line has a name followed by the amount of money the friend owns.
    For example:
    Helena 10

    This means Helena has 10 dollars.

    Next five lines, each line has two names and a number. The first friend gives the second friend the dollar amount.
    For example:
    Olivia Vincent 3

    This means Olivia gives Vincent 3 dollars as gift.
