'''

problem 1:
Write a function convert_to_celcius(farenheit) to convert celcius to farenheit

the function name should be convert_to_celcius
the function should take one argument, which is named farenheit
the function should return the celcius degree which is converted from the input.

To verify this function works, it should output when I call it using a integer value:

>> print (convert_to_celcius(32))

this should print 0

if I do
>> print (convert_to_celcius(212))
this should print 100.


problem 2

Write a function calculate_sum(n) to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n

the function name should be calculate_sum
the function should take one argument, which is named n
the function should return sum of all numbers from 1 to n.

To verify this function works, it should output when I call it using a integer value:

>> print (calculate_sum(10))

this should print 55

if I do
>> print (calculate_sum(100))
this should print 5050.
