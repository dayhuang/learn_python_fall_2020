A) write a program to compute the following:
    1. print the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 1000000 (You should get 500000500000)
    2. print the product of all the numbers from 1 to 20 (You should get 2432902008176640000)

B) write a program to compute the following:
    1. print the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 1000000 (You should get 250000500000)
    2. print the product of all the odd numbers from 1 to 20 (You should get 654729075)

C) write a program using input() function.
    if the number user input is smallest than 5, print the number
    if the number user input is greater than or equal to 5, stop the program
Example:
Please input a number smaller than 5
1
you input number is 1
Please input a number smaller than 5
3
you input number is 3
Please input a number smaller than 5
-1
you input number is -1
Please input a number smaller than 5
6
stop the loop on number 6
